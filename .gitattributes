# Git LFS configuration for large binary artifacts
# IMPORTANT: Keep patterns specific to avoid accidentally tracking all files
# 
# The following files were previously committed with LFS and remain tracked:
data/cleaned_enhanced.csv filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
models/xgboost_enhanced.joblib filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
#
# WARNING: Do NOT add broad patterns like *.csv or *.joblib here!
# They will cause Git LFS to try uploading ALL matching files in your repo.
# 
# If you need to track new large files with LFS, add specific paths only:
#   models/specific_model.joblib filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
